"""frlgsim - a Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen JOINER trade simulator over the LDN bridge.

A Pia client that joins a real FRLG console's link session and performs a full trade,
imitating the wireless CHILD (RFU MODE_CHILD, GBA mpId=1, trade.c "Follower"). The on-wire
behaviour is specified module-by-module; every module here cites the relevant decomp
`file.c:line` it implements.

Layer stack (bottom-up), one per-VBlank RFU command slot becomes:
    14-byte RFU slot (rfu.py)
      -> emulator 0x54 frame (gbaframe.py)
        -> Reliable(10) + Pia message (reliable.py)
          -> zstd (optional) + Pia AES-GCM (crypto.py)
            -> UDP :12345 (transport.py)

The input/output files are PKHeX-compatible .pk3 files (mon.py). The on-wire
100-byte party struct uses the encrypted, shuffled .ek3 form.

The overworld/seat phase (before the trade engine has block work) is driven by linkstate.py: a
held-keys (0xBE00) keepalive FSM that sits the joiner at the RIGHT seat (mpId 1) and exits via a
graceful cancel-to-leave, mirroring CB1_UpdateLinkState [src/overworld.c].

The host's standby / close-link barriers (READY_EXIT_STANDBY 0x6600 / READY_CLOSE_LINK 0x5F00) are
answered by barrier.py: a reactive responder inside the trade engine that mirrors the host's
broadcast round count so the host's IsLinkTaskFinished gate clears, mirroring the child branch of
Rfu_LinkStandby / SendReadyCloseLink [src/link_rfu_2.c:1471-1602].

The union-room -> trade-center ENTRY (the phase BEFORE S1) is modeled by trade.EntryPhase + a
REQ-driven 100B trainer-card supplier (linkplayer.build_trainer_card): P0/P3 standby windows answered
by barrier.py, P1 trainer-card pull (BLOCK_REQ_SIZE_100, count=9) supplied by the engine, P2 seat
held-keys READY by linkstate.py, P4/P5 handoff into the trade FSM. It is one-shot per session (never
re-fires on trades 2..6) [src/union_room.c:1753-1933; src/cable_club.c:827-942].
